				<p>“The complication of opinions and ideas, of affections and habits, which prompted the chevalier to devote himself to the service of a lady, and by which he strove to prove to her his love, and to merit hers in return, was expressed, in the language of the Troubadours, by a single word, by the word domnei, a derivation of <i xml:lang="pro">domna</i>, which may be regarded as an alteration of the Latin <i xml:lang="la">domina</i>, lady, mistress.”</p>
